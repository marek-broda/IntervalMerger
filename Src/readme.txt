- Instructions 
--------------

- Place CSV that you wish to process in the "CSVs" folder. 
- Change the name of the file in the main function within program.cs 
- Choose merge distance you want in there
- Should run through the CSV - merging, removing and deleting invervals 
  as required and writing the result to the console. 
- Stopwatch is being run on the main() function and gives a time at the end.

Notes 
----- 
After Delete, if delete is less than merge distance, unclear if this should merge 
back together again when we end up processing through again.
